# Model Modeling Language CLI

The [Model Modeling Language](https://github.com/eMoflon/model-modeling-language) (MML) is a domain-specific modeling language implemented with the open-source
language engineering tool [Langium](https://langium.org/). This repository contains a CLI that serves as a link between the Javascript-based MML and the Java-based Eclipse Modeling Framework as well as the HiPE Pattern Matcher.

The CLI can be integrated directly in the VSCode plugin of MML in order to access individual functions directly from the user interface, but it can also be executed in the command line, in which case inputs must be available as a file.
